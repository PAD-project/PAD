				<h1>CtF Challenges</h1>
				<p4>This page shows all the challenges of our Capture the Flag. You have to create a account to be able
					to complete these challenges.
					Our back end will manage your process and will show you how long you needed to complete the
					challenge. This will not be shared with other users.
					Only the time that's needed to complete the challenge for the first time will be recorded, we don't
					want to endurage speed runs. We want people to learn about our topic.
					It's only possible to enter the next challenge after you completed the one before that, this is
					because we want to learn people step by step about broken Authentication.
					And to be sure that you as a user don't get overwhelmed by the more difficult challenges. We have
					our challenges split up in 3 levels of difficulty, easy average and hard.
					We will also use humor in our challenges, don't feel personally attacked by it, we are just joking.
					Now with all the boring stuff out of the way let's start some challenges.</p4>

				<h2>Easy Challenges</h2>
				<p>These challenges are ranked easy and require no external programs or siginificant amounts of
					knowledge.</p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<h3>Inspect Element</h3>
						<p>Not a save way to store your password.</p>
						<button class="accordion">Intel</button>
						<div class="panel" style="display: none;">
							<p>A webpage is collection of text sorted in the form of elements or tags. These tags let’s
								the web browser know what is what on the page. In combination with webstyling we get the
								design of webpages. But it is possible for anybody visiting the website to inspect these
								elements that make up the webpage (also a good way to learn how something is built in
								your favorite website). If the developer puts sensitive data in these elements anybody
								can see them. You might think that encrypting this data is the solution but it’s not.
								There are a lot of free decrypting tools available online. </p>

						<h3>Mucho Dinero</h3>
						<p>Banking in the early 00's</p>
						<button class="accordion">Intel</button>
						<div class="panel" style="display: none;">
							<p>The first challenge was not something you would find the wild web, so we created another one very similar but more based on something that has been done in the past.
								In the early 2000’s, banks were hacked by inspecting elements, like we did in the first challenge.
								To learn about the history of cyber security we have recreated a website that’s vulnerable to this type of attack. 
								Your goal is retrieving the IBAN number, and his current balance.</p>

						<h3>find the source (NOT WORKING)</h3>
						<p>Source code exploits</p>
						<button class="accordion">Intel</button>
						<div class="panel" style="display: none;">
							<p>A lot of manufacturers have built in usernames and passwords, some examples are firmware,
								hardware, applications, or online tools. Think of your router it comes with a standard
								username and password for you to use to set up your home network. These kinds of
								exploits can also happen within the source code of programs. What is source code you
								might ask? A summary: Source code is the version of software as it is originally written
								by a human in plain text. Find out more ad<a

				<h2>Medium Challenges</h2>
				<p>The next challenges are a little bit harder, you will need to install programs to be able to complete these challenges.
					Don't worry we have checked the programs and they are not malicious. 
					We do have to warn about using these programs, if you do not have permission to use them in a computer system,
					your actions are illegal by dutch law!</p>

						<h4>Searching trough the dictionary</h4>
						<p>Bruteforce with lists</p>
						<button class="accordion">Intel</button>
						<div class="panel" style="display: none;">
							<p>The last challenge you had to guess the username and password, fine for a challenge but
								if you want to become the top cybercriminal you do not have time to do this.
								Unfortunately for us hackers have made tools to automate this process. So before we
								continue, ask yourself do I have a weak password or username? If yes change them, not
								after the challenge not tomorrow, no right now otherwise you will forget or postpone.
								Alright with that out of the way, let us explain how hackers use these tools. You saw
								that there are lists of most used usernames/passwords, hackers can write a program that
								try out every option by starting the program. Hackers can ad all the words from a
								dictionary to these programs, that is why words aren’t safe passwords. Now let’s try out
								such a list tool.</p>

						<h3>Maybe not the best username/password</h3>
						<p>Bruteforce by hand</p>
						<button class="accordion">Intel</button>
						<div class="panel" style="display: none;">
							<p>The weakest link in cyber security will always be humans and their lazyness. In 2020 83%
								of Americans used a not safe password. What is a not safe password you might ask? Let us
								give some examples. Passwords with less then 8 characters are not secure, any word found
								in a dictionary (English or foreign), date of birth, the name of your favorite band/pop
								icon. It is not only the average internet user that uses unsafe passwords, people that
								work in IT are also lazy (Admin is a regularly used username within IT systems).
								Finally, there are the well know lazy ones as 01234556789, abc123, Iloveyou, Dragon etc.
								Now let us start the guessing game.</p>

						<h3>Protect your storage</h3>
						<p>Database crack</p>
						<button class="accordion">Intel</button>

								your high score in a online video game or your banking credentials.
								It’s important that this data is protected in the database it’s stored in.</p>
