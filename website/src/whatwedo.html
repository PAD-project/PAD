							<h1>Extra information about us</h1>
                            <!--Hier kan de informatie over ons en ons project beschreven worden.-->
							<p>Welcome to the capture the flag challenge of Masters of Deception.
							<br />On this webiste you can challenge your hacking skills and knowledge about Broken Authentication.<br />
							In the navigation bar on the left you can find the challenges and some more information.</p>

							<h2>School Project</h2>
							<p2>This product is created from a school project. The aim of our project is to create a product which users can broaden their knowledge on security threats.
								our product foccuses on the Broken Authentication aspect, where users need to find the correct login credentials. 
								The other aspect of this project is to introduce its students to the SCRUM project method. 
								Most of us students are new to this method and have not used it in our previous project (FYS).</p2><br />

							<br><h2>Developers</h2>
							<p2>Our names are Max Klaver, Teun Bugera, Daan Huiberts, Hasan Konuksever and Sameer Butt. 
								We are students at the College in Amsterdam and study ICT - Cyber Security.</p2><br />

							<br><h4> - Max Klaver</h4>
							<p2>Hello, my name is Max Klaver and im 19 years old. Before i started at the HvA, i was in the military. 
								After 3 months and some personal issues i decided not to continue the course in the military and focus on something else 
								to maybe in a few years return to the military.
								After the military I found the course Cyber Security and I knew instantly that Cyber Security was something interesting.
								After some debate i decided to join the course and that is how I ended up right here.</p2><br />

							<br><h4> - Teun Bugera</h4>
							<p2>Let me start by introducing myself, I’m Teun Bugera 28 years old. I used to work as a chef, the pandemic forced me to think about my future. 
								As a teen I build a secret game server on the network of my high school. 
								I knew I wanted to do something in IT but didn’t know exactly which route I was going to take. 
								When I was reading the intel about all the IT routes the HvA offers, I felt a connection with cyber security. 
								I loved setting up computer networks and I never liked paying for a movie or music, and I wanted to learn how these exploits I used to do actually works.  
								I quickly learned that there is so much more information needed to be a good cyber security specialist, but till this day I love every aspect the HvA has thought me.</p2><br />

							<br><h4> - Daan Huiberts</h4>
							<p2>Hello everyone, my name is Daan Huiberts. I am a 17 year old cyber security enthousiast from the Netherlands. 
								I was introduced to the art of coding from a very young age, however I was not one of those kids that got their first smartphone on their 8th birthday 
								<small>(in fact I didn't get one until high school)</small>. 
								At the end of high school both me and my school found out my hidden talent, which was the art of cyber security (my school however didn't like the way how I discovered that talent). 
								From that point on I started further improving my skills and when I enrolled into college I started working on my own projects, like a unique Discord bot and a personal website. 
								Working on this CtF website has also been a fun project of mine and my second ever project made with a team of other computer science enthousiasts.</p2><br />

							<br><h4> - Hasan Konuksever</h4>
							<p2>Hi, my name is Hasan Konuksever. I am a 20 year old computer enthusiast from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
								At a young age I came in touch with computers and started to develop my passion for it that is still motivating me to pursue my career in IT. 
								In 2019 I worked with a team of 8 people, to build a lanparty for approximately 500 guests at the “Dream hack Rotterdam” event, which was awesome. 
								I also was a hardware tester as an intern at “Tweakers.net”, where I tested all kinds of computer components for reviews. 
								Recently I got my degree in system-administrator and I got my CCNA certificates. 
								As for now, I am currently studying for my bachelor’s degree in cyber-security. 
								I also like helping people with IT problems and build computers with my friends. 
								Working on this CTF project has been a blast, I hope you will have fun and learn more about cyber-security by completing the challenges.</p2><br />

							<br><h4> - Sameer Butt</h4>
							<p2>Hello everyone, my name is Sameer Butt. 
								I am a 20 year old infoSec enthousiast from the Netherlands. 
								I became interested with computers at a young age when i wondered “how does a computer work?”.  
								A simple question that lead to my passion for IT. 
								In 2017 i started with my MBO system and network administrator education which i finished in 2020(“i know”). 
								During those three years i gained my practical experiences through internships. 
								For my first internship in 2018 i went to Moldova with three others as part of a project installing a wifi network in a school. 
								During this project i was mostly cutting UTP cables but also got the task to configure a few accespoints and hanging them up.
								I really enjoyed this project because it was the first IT project that i worked on and learned a lot from. 
								In the same year i had my 2nd internship in UK, Wolverhampton. 
								This one is my favourite because i got my first experience of working abroad an living on my own with some fellow students. 
								I worked there at a web developing company where in the first weeks i had to go through the udemy coding courses(from which i learned more from in 2 weeks than school in 6 months). 
								For now i am following my bacchelor’s degree in cyber-security. Working on the this CtF- challenge website has been interesting and amazing. 
								I learnt some new skills that will help me develop further in IT. 
								I hope that you will enjoy and learn from this website as much as me and the others did.</p2>
