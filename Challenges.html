			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This page shows all the challenges of our Capture the Flag. You have to create a account to be able to complete these challenges.
				Our back end will manage your process and will show you how long you needed to complete the challenge. This will not be shared with other users.
				Only the time that's needed to complete the challenge for the first time will be recorded, we don't want to endurage speed runs. We want people to learn about our topic.
				It's only possible to enter the next challenge after you completed the one before that, this is because we want to learn people step by step about broken Authentication.
				And to be sure that you as a user don't get overwhelmed by the more difficult challenges. We have our challenges split up in 3 levels of difficulty, easy average and hard.
			We will also use humor in our challenges, don't feel personally attacked by it, we are just joking. Now with all the boring stuff out of the way let's start some challenges.</p>
